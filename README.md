# wordle
A recreation of the game wordle


The program takes a random word from the words csv file.

You then have 6 guesses.

If you get a letter in the correct spot it will come up as green.
If you get the right letter in the wrong spot, it will come up as yellow.
If you guess a wrong letter it will come up as red.

Any guesses that are not of length 5 will not be counted and you will be prompted to enter another word.
